    Converts a rate (events per time) to the probability of any event

    Rate must be A x R `np.ndarray`, where A is the number of
    age groups and R is the number of risk groups. Rate is transformed to

    When an instance is initialized, its `get_joint_realization` attribute
    is dynamically assigned to a method according to its `transition_type`
    attribute. This enables all instances to use the same method during
    simulation.

    Dimensions:
        M (int):
            number of outgoing compartments from the origin compartment
        A (int):
            number of age groups
        R (int):
            number of risk groups

    Attributes:
        origin (Compartment):
            Specifies origin of `TransitionVariableGroup` --
            corresponding populations leave this compartment.
        _transition_type (str):
            Only values defined in `JointTransitionTypes` are valid,
            specifies joint probability distribution of all outflows
            from origin.
        transition_variables (list[`TransitionVariable`]):
            Specifying `TransitionVariable` instances that outflow from origin --
            order does not matter.
        get_joint_realization (function):
            Assigned at initialization, generates realizations according
            to probability distribution given by `transition_type`,
            returns np.ndarray of either shape (M, A, R) or ((M+1), A, R),
            where M is the length of `transition_variables` (i.e., number of
            outflows from origin), A is the number of age groups, R is number of
            risk groups.
        current_vals_list (list):
            Used to store results from `get_joint_realization` --
            has either M or M+1 arrays of shape (A, R).
