class SusceptibleToExposed(clt.TransitionVariable):
    """
    TransitionVariable-derived class for movement from the
    "S" to "E" compartment. The functional form is the same across
    subpopulations.

    The rate depends on the corresponding subpopulation's
    contact matrix, transmission rate beta, number
    infected (symptomatic, asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic),
    and population-level immunity against infection,
    among other parameters.

    This is the most complicated transition variable in the
    flu model. If using metapopulation model (travel model), then
    the rate depends on the `total_mixing_exposure` attribute,
    which is a function of other subpopulations' states and
    parameters, and travel between subpopulations.

    If there is no metapopulation model, the rate
    is much simpler.
